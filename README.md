# Typing Test

This project is a Typing Test application built with Svelte. The application allows users to test their typing speed by typing a randomly loaded paragraph within a given time limit. It calculates words per minute (WPM), characters per minute (CPM), and tracks the number of mistakes made.

## Features

- **Random Paragraphs:** A new paragraph is loaded every time the game is reset.
- **Live Feedback:** Tracks correct and incorrect characters as you type.
- **Results Display:** Shows time left, number of mistakes, WPM, and CPM.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures the application looks good on all screen sizes.


## Technologies Used

- **Svelte:** A component-based JavaScript framework for building web interfaces.
- **JavaScript:** For handling application logic.
- **HTML/CSS:** For structuring and styling the application.


## Usage

1. Start typing in the input field as soon as the application loads a paragraph.
2. The application will automatically start the timer as you begin typing.
3. The WPM and CPM will be updated in real-time.
4. Click the "Try Again" button to reset the test with a new paragraph.
